      <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">
        Hello there! I'm Zulfikar from Jakarta, a 20-year-old student with a passion 
        for both International Relations and Data Analytics. Currently, I am in my 4th semester 
        at Universitas Pembangunan Nasional Veteran Jakarta.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Outside of my classes, I like to focus on practical ways to improve what I'm learning. 
        I believe there's more to learning than just textbooks. I particularly enjoy working on 
        data analytics projects. My goal is to bring together Data and International Relations 
        to make a positive impact in those fields. I want to create positive changes and improve 
        understanding between nations.

      <p class="paragraph">
        My studies at International Relations UPNVJ were both challenging and rewarding. 
        I learned a lot about world issues, how to think critically, and how to analyze information. 
        This prepared me well for a future career in international relations. Being part of "Himpunan 
        Mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional UPNVJ" was also a great experience. I made friends, learned 
        leadership and organizations skills, and participated in activities that helped me understand 
        Rnternational Relations even better.

      <p class="paragraph">
        My high school experience at MAN 2 Jakarta was focused on foreign languages and communications. 
        This program helped me develop strong skills in both areas, which have been valuable in my life. 
        Being a part of MPK (Majelis Perwakilan Kelas) not only provided me with leadership experience and 
        teamwork skills but also helped me understand the diverse perspectives of my classmates. 
        I consistently performed well academically, even ranking at the top of my class. 
        Interestingly, while excelling in language and communication, my favorite subject, and the one 
        where I achieved my highest score, was actually math, which highlight my diverse academic interests.

        to understand what it might be like to participate on a data analyst team at Quantium.
        I worked on a tasks to conduct analyses on a client's transaction dataset and
        identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide
        commercial recommendations. I used Python and built my Data Visualisation in PowerBI. 
        <br> <br>

        My responsibilities in this internship included:
        <br> <br>

        - Analyzed transaction and customer data to identify trends and inconsistencies.<br>
        - Developed metrics and examine sales drivers to gain insights into overall sales performance. <br>
        - Created visualizations and prepare findings to formulate a clear recommendation for the client's strategy.<br>
        - Defined metrics to select control stores.<br>
        - Analyzed trial stores against controls.<br>
        - Used Python for data analysis and visualization and summarise findings and provide recommendations.<br>
        - Used the Pyramid Principles framework for structuring the report.<br>
        - Created a report that incorporates data visualizations, key insights, and recommendations.
