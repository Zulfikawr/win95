        I recently participated in Quantium's Virtual Internship, and it was incredibly useful 
        to understand what it might be like to participate on a data analyst team at Quantium.
        I worked on a project to conduct analyses on a client's transaction dataset and
        identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide
        commercial recommendations. I used Python and built my Data Visualisation in PowerBI.

        I recently participated in Quantium's Virtual Internship, and it was incredibly useful 
        to understand what it might be like to participate on a data analyst team at Quantium.
        I worked on a project to conduct analyses on a client's transaction dataset and
        identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide
        commercial recommendations. I used Python and built my Data Visualisation in PowerBI. 
        <br> <br>

        My responsibilities in this project included:
        <br> <br>

        - Analyzed transaction and customer data to identify trends and inconsistencies.<br>
        - Developed metrics and examine sales drivers to gain insights into overall sales performance. <br>
        - Created visualizations and prepare findings to formulate a clear recommendation for the client's strategy.<br>
        - Defined metrics to select control stores.<br>
        - Analyzed trial stores against controls.<br>
        - Used Python for data analysis and visualization and summarise findings and provide recommendations.<br>
        - Used the Pyramid Principles framework for structuring the report.<br>
        - Created a report that incorporates data visualizations, key insights, and recommendations.
